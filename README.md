# CLI CRUD System for PostgreSQL ‚Äî VerticalLife Project

This project provides a robust command-line interface (CLI) for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a PostgreSQL database, with support for multiple schemas and tables. The system is designed to be secure, modular, and user-friendly, enabling dynamic interaction with database structure.

Additionally, the repository includes performance testing scripts to compare search efficiency with and without indexes, highlighting the impact of index optimization in PostgreSQL.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
2. Create the database and load the schemas using the provided `.sql` files.
3. (Optional) Populate the database using `name_generator.py`.
4. Run the CRUD interface:

```bash
python crudVerticalLife.py
